/* Example from: https://code-maze.com/csharp-async-vs-multithreading/
   
   When performing blocking operations between the methods, we should use asynchronous programming. In scenarios where
   we have a fixed thread pool or when we need vertical scalability in the application, we use asynchronous programming.
   
   When we have independent functions performing independent tasks, we should use multithreading. One good example
   of this will be downloading multiple files from multiple tabs in a browser. Each download will run in its own thread.*/

           So, why is this happening? Because once the thread hits the awaiting operation in FirstAsync, the thread is 
           freed from that method and returned to the thread pool. Once the operation is completed and the method has
           to continue, a new thread is assigned to it from a thread pool. The same process is repeated for the
           SecondAsync and ThirdAsync as well. */

        /* We can clearly see the execution of multithreaded methods on different threads as expected. But also, they
         are keeping the same threads for the continuation compared to the async methods.
        
            From this example, we can see the main difference â€“ Multithreading is a programming technique for executing 
            operations running on multiple threads (also called workers) where we use different threads and block them
            until the job is done. Asynchronous programming is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks (here the
            assigned thread is returned back to a thread pool once the await keyword is reached in the method). */
